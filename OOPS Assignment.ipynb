    "Ans 1:  The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Encapsulation helps to hide the internal state of the object and only expose a controlled interface. This ensures that the object's data cannot be altered or accessed in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using private variables and providing public getter and setter methods to control access to those variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows you to work with high-level concepts while ignoring the lower-level details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Abstraction reduces complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level, rather than on implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A car object might expose methods like drive() or stop() without needing to expose or understand the details of how the engine works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class, called a child or derived class, is created from an existing class, called a parent or base class. The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class and can also add new attributes and methods or override existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A Dog class might inherit from an Animal class, reusing common attributes like name and age and methods like eat() and sleep(), while adding or modifying behavior specific to dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). In simpler terms, polymorphism allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Polymorphism promotes flexibility and the ability to interchange objects in code, making it easier to extend and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A function that takes a Shape object can work with Circle, Square, or Triangle objects because they all implement the Shape interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Composition is a design principle in which a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, rather than inheriting from a base class. It represents a \"has-a\" relationship, where one class contains an instance of another class as a field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Composition allows for more flexible and modular designs by building complex objects from simpler ones, rather than relying on a rigid inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A Car class might be composed of Engine, Wheel, and Transmission objects, representing the fact that a car \"has an\" engine, wheels, and a transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Hides data and implementation, exposing only the necessary parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Simplifies complex systems by showing only the relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Reuses and extends existing code by creating a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Allows objects of different types to be used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition: Builds complex objects by combining simpler ones, favoring flexibility over inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are foundational to OOP and are used to create modular, maintainable, and reusable code."

    "\n",
    "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python determines the order in which classes are searched when invoking a method or accessing an attribute in the presence of inheritance, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios. When you call a method on an instance, Python follows the MRO to find where that method is defined.\n",

    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "- The MRO determines the sequence in which base classes are checked when a method is called.\n",
    "- In single inheritance, the MRO is straightforward: the class itself and its direct parent classes are checked in sequence.\n",
    "- In multiple inheritance, Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to ensure a consistent and unambiguous resolution order.\n",

    "The __str__ method is used to define the string representation of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "When you use print() on an object or call str() on it, Python uses the __str__ method to determine what to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, __str__ is overridden to provide a formatted string representation of a complex number, e.g., \"3 + 4i\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__add__ Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The __add__ method defines how two objects of the class should be added together using the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, __add__ is overridden to add two ComplexNumber objects by separately adding their real and imaginary parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "When you write c1 + c2, Python automatically calls the __add__ method, returning a new ComplexNumber object that represents the sum of the two.\n",

    "    \n",
    "What These Methods Allow You to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom String Representation: By overriding __str__, you can control how your objects are represented as strings, making it easier to display and understand the object's data when printed or logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator Overloading: By overriding __add__, you can define how the + operator works for your objects, enabling intuitive mathematical operations that align with the nature of the objects (e.g., adding complex numbers, points, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
